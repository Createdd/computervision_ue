- good intro
  - https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/unsupervised-learning-and-convolutional-autoencoder-for-image-anomaly-detection-b783706eb59e
- very simple keras conv autoencoder exampl
  - https://keras.io/examples/vision/autoencoder/
- good example autoencoder keras on fashiondataset

  - most of this approach was used for you example so far
  - it detects the loss for ssim which seems very promising. needs to be elaborated with more training epochs
- similar code but other article? https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/image-anomaly-detection-using-autoencoders-ae937c7fd2d1
- for details on architecture
  - section on conv autoencoder
  - https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html
- this might be interesting for fine-tuning afterwards?
